# Blackbird Analytics with Power BI

This repository hosts a Power BI project designed to provide a comprehensive overview of Blackbird, a US-based wholesaler. This Power BI file is intended to provide information and guidance for the managers of Blackbird. This project leverages Power BI to visualise and analyse data related to **Orders Data**, **Sales and Product Analysis**, **Geographical Insights**, and **Operational Insights**.

## Project Overview

The Power BI report (`MT412_PowerBi_Group3.pbip`) offers insights into Blackbird's sale data from 2014 - 2017. It's designed to help stakeholders make informed decisions by providing a clear view of some **key insights** of the business.

### Key Insights

**1. Orders and Product Breakdown:** The Orders Data dashboard and Sales & Product Analysis dashboard provide a comprehensive description of the orders and product sales of the company. Data in regards to order by date, orders by category, top-5 selling states by orders as well as total quantity of sales, total profit, and unique number of customers can be seen visualised on the *Orders Data* dashboard. Data in regards to product sales, top-5 customers, sales by months as well as total number of sales, total cost of sales, and unique number of products can be seen visualised on the *Sales & Product Analysis* dashboard.

**2. Geographic Insights:** The Geographic Insights dashboard provides an overview of how the company is performing in the US. The dashboard utilises a shape map visualisation of the US that is coloured by sales volume. This visualisation provides Blackbird with key information regarding which states have the most sales. There is also a filled map that showcases the most popular sub-category sold in each state which provides Blackird with regional preferences information.

**3. Operational Insights:** The Operational Insights dashboard is created to provide managers and stakeholders of Blackbird with information concerning the company's operational performance. There is a Q&A visualisation to provide quick and simple information, a card visualisation to showcase the top-selling product by category, a doughnut ring visualisation that provides a breakdown of the most common modes of shipping by category, and a discount impact analysis graph to see how much sales are affected by the average discount rate.
